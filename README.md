Minum Framework

A web framework demonstrating [_"less is more"_](http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)

Minum is a framework that provides solely those components
necessary to create a web-based application, including a web server, pared-down database,
template processor, and other necessary features. It differs from a library in
that it does not merely cater for a motley assortment of needs, but instead,
covers every core need of a web application, minimalistically.

For more detail on intentions, purpose, and benefits, see the
[development handbook](docs/development_handbook.md).

Example projects demonstrating usage:
-------------------------------------

See the following links for sample projects that use this framework.

- [Example](https://github.com/byronka/minum_usage_example_mvn) 

This is a good example to see a basic project with various functionality. It
shows many of the typical use cases of the Minum framework.

- [Smallest-possible](https://github.com/byronka/minum_usage_example_smaller)

This project is valuable to see the minimal-possible application that can
be made.  This might be a good starting point for use of Minum on a new project.
