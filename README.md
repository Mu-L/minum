Example projects demonstrating usage:
-------------------------------------

See the following links for sample projects that use this framework.

- [Example](https://github.com/byronka/minum_usage_example_mvn) 

This is a good example to see a basic project with various functionality. It
shows many of the typical use cases of the Minum framework.

- [Smallest-possible](https://github.com/byronka/minum_usage_example_smaller)

This project is valuable to see the minimal-possible application that can
be made.  This might be a good starting point for use of Minum on a new project.
