Minum Web Framework
===================

When you want to write a web application that is fast and maintainable and (big-picture) less expensive.  For 
when you prefer a stable foundation with minimal dependencies and not a [teetering tower](https://xkcd.com/2347/).

If these speak to you:

If you realize there is no silver bullet, there are no shortcuts, that hard work is the only way to create 
value, then you might share my mindset about what makes this web framework valuable.

For more detail on intentions, purpose, and benefits, see the
[development handbook](docs/development_handbook.md).

Example projects demonstrating usage:
-------------------------------------

See the following links for sample projects that use this framework.

- [Example](https://github.com/byronka/minum_usage_example_mvn) 

This is a good example to see a basic project with various functionality. It
shows many of the typical use cases of the Minum framework.

- [Smallest-possible](https://github.com/byronka/minum_usage_example_smaller)

This project is valuable to see the minimal-possible application that can
be made.  This might be a good starting point for use of Minum on a new project.
