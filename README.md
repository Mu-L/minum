Minum Framework
===============

A web framework demonstrating [_"less is more"_](http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)

> It is better to do a simple thing today and pay a little more tomorrow to change it
> if it needs it, than to do a more [complicated](docs/simplify_then_add_lightness.md) thing today 
> that may never be used anyway.
> 
> -- Kent Beck, _Extreme Programming Explained_
