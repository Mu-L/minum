If you wish to contribute to the project
========================================

Thank you! Your assistance is greatly appreciated. There are some unusual paradigms for this 
project, please review that section before going further.


Unusual paradigms
-----------------

This is an opinionated minimalist web framework to develop server-side-rendered monolith hypermedia web
applications. Some of the thinking behind this project is described in the [development handbook](docs/development_handbook.md/#on-minimalism).

This paradigm emphasizes developing the leanest interface with the fewest technologies, written 
as frugally and plainly as achievable and warranted. Performance, security, and maintainability are vital.

Strive for high-quality software that provides exactly what is needed, but no more.


What is needed
--------------

* Documentation
* Examples
* Refinements and refactorings
* Maintenance
* Fresh ideas
* Reporting security vulnerabilities
* Performance tuning
* Bug removal
* Expanded testing


How to start
------------

Please create an issue or discussion to explain the situation.  Please do not start by providing
a full implementation - let the conversation happen first.

New features will require a compelling explanation of the anticipated benefits.  Minimalism can only be maintained
by strictness about what is allowed into the codebase.
