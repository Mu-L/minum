/**
 * An HTTP request.
 * <p>
 * From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#Request_syntax">Wikipedia</a>
 * </p>
 *<p>
 *     A client sends request messages to the server, which consist of:
 *</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *      a request line, consisting of the case-sensitive request
 *      method, a space, the requested URL, another space, the
 *      protocol version, a carriage return, and a line feed, e.g.:
 *      <pre>
 *          GET /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1
 *      </pre>
 *      </li>
 *
 *      <li>
 *      zero or more request header fields (at least 1 or more
 *      headers in case of HTTP/1.1), each consisting of the case-insensitive
 *      field name, a colon, optional leading whitespace, the field
 *      value, an optional trailing whitespace and ending with a
 *      carriage return and a line feed, e.g.:
 *
 *      <pre>
 *      Host: www.example.com
 *      Accept-Language: en
 *      </pre>
 *      </li>
 *
 *      <li>
 *      an empty line, consisting of a carriage return and a line feed;
 *      </li>
 *
 *      <li>
 *      an optional message body.
 *      </li>
 *      In the HTTP/1.1 protocol, all header fields except Host: hostname are optional.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * A request line containing only the path name is accepted by servers to
 * maintain compatibility with HTTP clients before the HTTP/1.0 specification in RFC 1945.
 *</p>

     * This getter will process the body data fully on the first

     * <br>
     * If there is a need to deal with very large data, such as
     * large images or videos, consider using {@link #getSocketWrapper()}
     * instead, which will allow fine-grained control over pulling
     * the bytes off the socket.
     * <br>
     * For instance, if expecting a video (a large file), it may be prudent to store
     * the data into a file while it downloads, so that the server
     * does not need to hold the entire file in memory.
     * <h3>Further explanation:</h3>
     * <p>
     *     The body contains the data beyond the initial status line and headers.
     *     For example, you will find HTML, images, and other bulk data stored
     *     in the body.  If you are expecting data sent in a POST, it is usually
     *     found in the body.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *     By calling this method, the entire body contents will be read.  In the case
     *     of ordinary-sized data, this is not a problem.  But, for the sake of explanation,
     *     if the data were a gigabyte in size, then your server would need to set aside
     *     that much in memory for it.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *     It is therefore a security concern, and the defaults of the Minum system are
     *     set to prevent security failures.  It is recommended that the developer
     *     handle such large data by another means, such as by using the aforementioned {@link #getSocketWrapper()}.
     *     By default, the system will not read the body if the content-length is greater
     *     than the size specified by MAX_READ_SIZE_BYTES, described in the Constants class and
     *     in the "minum.config" file.
